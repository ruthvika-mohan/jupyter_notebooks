2. Chemical Classifier

  A chemist has two chemical flasks labelled 1 and 0 which contains two different chemicals. 
  He extracted 3 features from these chemicals in order to distinguish between them. 
  You are provided with the results derived by the chemist and your task is to create 
  a model that will label chemical 0 or 1 given its three features.

 4. Homework Challenge 
 
  X values contain number of hours of effort
  y values contain marks obtained 
  
 5. Pollution Challenge
 
  It is winter time in Delhi so Cody decided to go for a walk to the news stand and on 
  reaching was surprised to see the air quality index of Delhi in the newspaper . 
  So he decided to collect the air samples of different locations and then took 
  these samples to his lab where he extracted five features of the air he 
  collected which can be used to predict the air quality index and combined it 
  with the air quality index given in the newspapers. 
  You are provided with the data collected by Cody and your 
  job is to design a machine learning model which given the 
  features extracted by Cody can predict air quality
